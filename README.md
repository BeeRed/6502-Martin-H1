# 6502
 A collection of 6502 projects in a monorepo

Overview
======
The purpose of this project is to collect my 6502 projects into a single repo and share resuable code from a common directory.

Prerequisites
======
* Windows or Linux with Python 3.6, Ophis, and Py65Mon installed.
* Git to fetch these files.

Files
======
* .gitignore - prevents target files from getting checked into git.
* common.mk - common make rules used by unit makefiles.
* LICENSE - MIT license file.
* README.md - this file.
## Common = reusable data structures and functions.

Notes:
======
Ophis depends upon Python 2.6. Under Windows Ophis includes its own copy of
Python. On Linux you need to install it.
